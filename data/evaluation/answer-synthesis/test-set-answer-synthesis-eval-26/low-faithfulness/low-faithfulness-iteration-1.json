However, the answer includes several unsupported negative/qualifying claims not present in the context — e.g., statements that specific courses “do not cover” advanced software development, web/app integration, advanced network coding/security, large-model training or deployment, or that no course prepares for a complete end-to-end tech job. Those are interpretive assertions beyond the explicit learning outcomes and thus reduce faithfulness."
